HOW TO RUN:

Clone the repository from github into a directory (your choice on whether to use Powershell, WSL, Command Prompt, or whatever your system has. 
Just make sure you know the appropriate commands for your system). Move into thr CMSC421-HW directory that should not exist after you've cloned 
the directory from github. 

To run the algorithms for grader testing run "python main.py < (insert your infile name)". If your infile is located outside of the CMSC421-HW2 
directory you will have to specify the path. If you copy it into the directory then you only need the text file name. The CSV files for each algorithm 
will be generated and the file's get overwritten for each time you run the main.py file.

To run the experiments run "python run_parts.py" and a seperate directory for each part 1-3 will be generated seperately with the appropriate graphs in each directory.


PART1  WRITE-UP

For most of the graph sizes, the RNN algorithm running with 2 restarts provided the lowest cost as shown by the graph below
